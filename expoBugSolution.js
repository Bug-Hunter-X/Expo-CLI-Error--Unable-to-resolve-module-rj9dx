The solution to the "Unable to resolve module" error depends on the root cause. Here are some steps you can take:

1. **Check Network Connectivity:** Ensure you have a stable internet connection. Expo CLI relies on network access to download and manage dependencies.
2. **Clear Expo Cache:** Run `expo start --clear` to clear the Expo CLI cache. This can resolve issues caused by corrupted cached files.
3. **Verify Dependencies:** Check your `package.json` file to ensure all dependencies are correctly listed and specified. Then run `npm install` or `yarn install` to install them.
4. **Reinstall Expo CLI:** If the problem persists, consider reinstalling Expo CLI globally: `npm uninstall -g expo-cli` followed by `npm install -g expo-cli`.
5. **Check Project Configuration:** Inspect your project's configuration files (e.g., `app.json` or `babel.config.js`) to ensure they are correctly set up and compatible with your Expo version.
6. **Verify Node.js and npm:** Make sure you have compatible versions of Node.js and npm installed. Check the Expo documentation for recommended versions.
7. **Restart Your System:** Sometimes, a simple system restart can resolve temporary glitches.
8. **Check for Conflicting Packages:** In some cases, conflicting packages might cause this error. Look for dependency conflicts in your project and resolve them.
